# Utilizing Hadoop MapReduce to analyze airline data

## Program Overview
I have written some MapReduce jobs to answer the following questions with this [dataset](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/Fields.asp?Table_ID=236):

1. What is the best time-of-the-day/day-of-week/time-of-year to fly to minimize delays?
2. What is the worst time-of-the-day / day-of-week/time-of-year to fly to minimize delays?
3. What are the major hubs (busiest airports) in continental U.S.? Please list the top 10. Has
there been a change over the 21-year period covered by this dataset?
4. Which carriers have the most delays? You should report on the total number of delayed
flights and also the total number of minutes that were lost to delays. Which carrier has the
highest average delay?
5. Do older planes cause more delays? Contrast their on-time performance with newer planes.
Planes that are more than 20 years will be considered old.
6. Which cities experience the most weather-related delays? Please list the top 10.
7. Is there a shift in airline traffic during different months of the year?
